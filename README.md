# Schedule Maker

## Description

This is a daily schedule maker application. you can store daily taska by hour and it will indicate if this hour has passed, is currently happening or is in the future.

There are 9 different rows of tasks labeled from 9am - 5pm. each row has a text area where a user can write what task they want to do at that time and click a save button next to it so it stores in local storage. When the specific hour has passed the box with the time in it will turn red symbolizing that the hour is passed. if a box displaying the time is blue it shows that it is current in that hour, and if it shows green that means the hour has not come yet/it is in the future.
